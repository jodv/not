### not
as in note, without the e(vernote)

i need to take notes on a daily basis, but i hate all note taking software

i just want to scratch down some crap in vi and save it somewhere safe and synced

geeknote is cool (and largely inspired not), but it's super feature rich and requires extra brain workyness

`not "some note"` and I'm done

### install
python setup.py install


### usage
`not` -- creates or updates a note using your favorite linux editor, stored in default notebook, named after today's date

`not some_title` same thing, but instead of todays date it's whatever custom title you wrote

all notes are plaintext
